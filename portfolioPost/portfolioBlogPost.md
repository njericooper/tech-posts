Over the last 4 months, I've built and scrapped 3 versions of my personal website. It was missing a lot of stuff and I wasn't able to figure out exactly what without guidance. After reading several books and taking courses, it was clear that my website was basic. It had no special web technologies. It would not help me become the developer that's behind the title. The process was meticulous, but I learned the significance of having a personal portfolio. Here are the key takeaways from my journey:

#### Select All + Delete  and Start From Scratch

Sometimes we become attached and get married to our visions and ideas. Over these 4 months, I've learned that most ideas suck and the vision may not serve the projected end user. My site wasn't live. It had no monthly traffic. There were no backlinks directed to it, so instead of trying to put Fabreze on the poop pile of my site, I nuked it. When I started over, each time I had more knowledge, skill, and technique than the last time.

#### Use Your Best Tools

I got comfortable with showcasing relevant tools and technologies, but not overdoing it. It didn't make sense to have a dropdown menu with aria states or an animated CSS email form. ðŸ˜” Instead, I made a beautiful button that linked to my CodePen projects. That made more sense because that's where I've put these types of projects on display. The nav bar I wanted to use had transitions and lots of Javascript to show off my arrow function skills. Woefully, I had to be okay with using Javascript sparingly.

Create your site with the languages and tools you want to be hired to use.

#### Be The Product

I love creating... for other people. I had a hard time becoming and making my website the product. It took an old school product design session of outlining the user personas and their tasks to drive it home for me. I am what the user wants to see. My image, title, and skills needed to be above the fold, not below like when I'm creating other things.

#### Bonus: aSk FoR hElp

As a junior dev, I'd have to be psychic to know what exactly hiring managers are looking for. Either that or I'd have sat in on interviews or had senior dev workload. I haven't done that, but I do know a few devs I could have critique my projects.

You may not want to bother your super smart and busy network with something as simple as a portfolio.  If it means leveling up into the next tax bracket, eh. Remember, there's no such thing as a stupid question. You know what they say, "better safe than under valued."
