<p> CSS Flexbox is a uni-directional way layout components of your website one at a time. Elements can only be ordered in either a row or in a column when the display is set to "flex" then ordered and spaced to it's desired position. For ease and brevity, I quickly learned the importance of creating containers for all of my items/child elements. </p>

<p> The first feature I tackled was the nav bar. Creating a simple nav bar in CSS Flexbox was simpler than I thought. Here's a snippet of the HTML and CSS I used.</p>

**HTML**

<nav class="nav-container">
            <ul class="nav-items">
                <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
    
                <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
    
                <li><a href="#">Blog</a></li>
    
                <li><a href="#">Contact Us</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>

**CSS**
   
body, html{
                width: 100%;
                padding: 0;
                margin: 0;
                font-family: Arial;
}
.nav-items{
          list-style: none;
          margin: 0; 
          background: black;
          display: flex;
          flex-flow: row wrap;
          justify-content: flex-end;
                
}
            
.nav-items a{
          text-decoration: none;
          display: block;
          padding: 1em;
          color: white;
          font-size: 2em;
}
            
.nav-items a:hover{
          text-decoration: underline;
}




<p> For the nav bar, I didn't need to style the nav container itself, instead, we're just going to apply flex as the display the nav items. "Flex-flow" is a shorthand element that combines "flex-direction" and "flex-wrap". It determines whether the direction is going to be in a horizontal row or in a vertical column and also if the items will wrap around to the next line, wrap in reverse, or not wrap at all.</p>
    
<p>"nowrap" is the default, so I changed it to "wrap". I also applied a wrap to the row for responsitivity (hamburger menu for mobile coming soon).</p>

<p> "Justify-content" sets the alignment of the items in the container. Just like with text, there's right, center, and left, but we use "flex-start" to align items towards the beginning, "center", and "flex-end" for alignment towards the end of the flex container; there are a few other options that set the spacing of items, but they are not necessary here. For this nav bar, I chose "flex-end" for the nav-items and added 1 em of padding between each a tag. </p>
